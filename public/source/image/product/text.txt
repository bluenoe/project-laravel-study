coffee spilled across the console  
rain tapping like keyboard keys —  
tick tick tick —  
someone said “bro you okay?”

stack overflow of nostalgia  
while (heart == heavy) { keep_typing(); }  

we used to laugh inside the chatroom

> dream_02: trying to sudo your way out of loneliness  
> dream_03: permission denied.

else printf("same day different bug");

heart syncing
